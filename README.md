# Pxl Potion Node/Express Boilerplate
This repo will serve as a boilerplate for standard MVC style Node.js applications. The application is built with minimum dependencies and is meant to be expanded on a per project basis.

To run:
- `git clone repo-name`
- `cd repo-name`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

The app should no be running on: `http://localhost:3000`. Note that this script uses `nodemon` to monitor for changes and restart the server.

What to do next:
- Navigate to the `/config/config` file and setup different environment variables.
- Navigate to the `/app/controllers/example.js` file and either delete it or rename/refactor it.
- Navigate to the `/app/middlewares/example.js` file and either delete it or rename/refactor it.
- Navigate to the `/app/views/example.js` file and either delete it or rename/refactor it.
